      </header>
      <p>My name is Shannon Coleman. I am from Birmingham Alabama, but my birth place is from a little place called Dothan Alabama. I have a wife and two kids that keep me busy and always on my toes. I am here to start a new adventure to expand out into a new career. I am somewhat familure with using computers but that was years ago. Even though this is an intense bootcamp, I believe I am up for the challenge. I look forward to seeing what else I can learn on this adventure. </p>
